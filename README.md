### Code on the Blockchain - Electronic Contract Scripts


#### Contract Structure

> The day-one functionality of the contract scripts includes:
>                
> - Keep track of the genes of upcoming gen0 CryptoKitties
> - Introducing the genes of gen0 CryptoKitties to the Core Contract
> - Launching the auctions for gen0 CryptoKitties (including price determination)
> - Combining the genotypes of two parent CryptoKitties to determine the genotype of the new CryptoKitten
> - Managing the auctions of CryptoKitties (both gen-0 cats being auctioned to users and user-to-user auctions) and siring tokens
> - Managing siring auctions (including initiating the breeding when successful).
>
>  All functionality for breeding, buying, selling, and transferring cats 
> will be possible for any user by interacting directly with the contracts on the blockchain.
> Any auctions or sales conducted through our auction contract 
> will include a 3.75% commission (no minimum) taken from the seller's portion.

#### Non-fungible Token (NFT) Standard - Ethereum Request for Comments #721 (ERC-721)

_CryptoKitties provides a practical use case for digital scarcity 
and digital collectibles by pioneering ERC-721, a non-fungible token protocol_


A standard interface allows any Non-fungible Token (NFTs) on Ethereum 
to be handled by general-purpose applications. 
In particular, it will allow for Non-fungible Token (NFTs) 
to be tracked in standardized wallets and traded on exchanges.


Compatibility Functions for Ethereum Request for Comments #20 (ERC-20)

- function **name**() constant returns (string name)
- function **symbol**() constant returns (string symbol)
- function **totalSupply**() constant returns (uint256 totalSupply)
- function **balanceOf**(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance)

Basic Ownership Functions

- function **ownerOf**(uint256 _tokenId) constant returns (address owner)
- function **approve**(address _to, uint256 _tokenId)
- function **takeOwnership**(uint256 _tokenId)
- function **transfer**(address _to, uint256 _tokenId)
- function **tokenOfOwnerByIndex**(address _owner, uint256 _index) constant returns (uint tokenId)

Metadata Functions

- function **tokenMetadata**(uint256 _tokenId) constant returns (string infoUrl)

Events

- event **Transfer**(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _tokenId)
- event **Approval**(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 _tokenId)

**The CryptoKitty Bounty Program** (github: [axiomzen/cryptokitties-bounty](https://github.com/axiomzen/cryptokitties-bounty)) 

> CryptoKitties is composed of 4 public facing contracts. Below we'll provide an overview on these contracts:
>
> ##### KittyCore.sol - `0x16baf0de678e52367adc69fd067e5edd1d33e3bf`
>
> Also referred as the main contract, is where Kitties and their ownership are stored.
> This also mediates all the main operations, such as breeding, exchange, and part of auctions.
> 
> For this release, the actual bytecode released for the contract is `KittyCoreRinkeby.sol`, explained below.
> 
> ##### SaleClockAuction.sol - `0x8a316edee51b65e1627c801dbc09aa413c8f97c2`
> 
> Where users are expected to acquire their gen0 kitten. It is also a marketplace where anyone can post their kitten for auction.
> [See Dutch/Clock auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction) - note we also accept an increasing price.
> ps: CryptoKitties auctions take an initial time and duration, and after duration is over they are not closed. 
> Instead they hold the final price indefinitely
>
> ##### SiringClockAuction.sol - `0x07ca8a3a1446109468c3cf249abb53578a2bbe40`
>
> A marketplace where any user can offer their Kitty as a potential sire for any takers.
>
> ##### GeneScience.sol
>
> It's a mystery! Not public for this release.
>
>
> [...]
>

### Inside CryptoKitties Genetics

_cdcd 5656 4744 gfg4 66d4 7877 eccf 251j 77k7 222k gddg ddea_


The 256-bit genome (genes) have over 4-billion variations of phenotypes (what you see) 
and genotypes (what you don't see).


[**The CryptoKitties Genome Project**](https://medium.com/@kaigani/the-cryptokitties-genome-project-68582016f687) by Kai, Dec 19 

> Here's what I've found:
> - Genes are stored in 12 blocks of 4x5-bit codes
> - Each 5-bit code represents a cattribute associated with the position in the gene (body, pattern type, eye color, eye type, primary color, pattern color, secondary color, fancy type, mouth)
> - Each block of 4 codes represents 1 dominant trait expressed in the Kitty followed by 3 recessive traits.
> - Codes are passed from either parent to child, with a low probability of swapping from the 1st recessive, and a lower probability of swapping from the 2nd or 3rd recessive.

> CryptoKitties is not holding an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). 
> Instead, we're offering utility from day one and pursuing a sustainable revenue model based on our games' mechanics.

[**Cryptokitties @ Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptokitties)

> CryptoKitties offers something similar to a cryptocurrency: each CryptoKitty is one-of-a-kind, 100% owned by the user, validated
> through the blockchain, and the value can appreciate or depreciate based on the market.
> Cryptokitties cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.

### Questions & Answers

_Tech_

**Q: Couldn't CryptoKitties be hosted on many types of databases besides a blockchain?**

> A: Crypto-collectibles have key properties that proprietary digital collectibles didn't: 
> longevity, code-enforced scarcity and rules, resistance to actions of sponsoring company. 
> Much closer to non-digital collectibles like baseball cards than pre-crypto digital goods.

> -- [CryptoKitties](https://twitter.com/CryptoKitties/status/940302318792163328) - Dec/11



**Q: What's the population? How many gen0 kitties will there be?**

A: 50_000 – Every 15 minutes a new gen0 kitty gets added (that is, 672 kitties per week) 
until reaching a limit of 50_000 in one year (end of November 2018).

![](i/cryptokitties-gen.png)

(Source: [Kitty Explorer / Generation Breakdown](http://www.kittyexplorer.com))



**Q: What make's a kitty good?**

A: The generation, cooldown speed, traits, and all affect the overall price and desirability of the kitties.
Generally, anything gen(eration) 0/1/2/3/4, with fast/swift/snappy/brisk is a good kitty. Rare traits make it even better.

**Generation.** The best generation of kitty is Gen 0. 
The lower the generation number, the better starting cooldown the kitty is born with. 

When breeding two kitties together, the resulting generation will be one higher than the highest generation parent. 
For example:

* If a Gen 0 and Gen 0 breed, the kitten will be Gen 1. 
* If a Gen 5 and Gen 5 breed, the kitten will be Gen 6.
* If a Gen 0 and a Gen 5 breed, the kitten will be Gen 6.

**Cooldowns.**  Each time a kitty breeds another kitty it needs a
period of cooldown time to recover. The cooldown wait time increases (moves down one level) each time the kitty breeds
until it reaches "catatonic" cooldown, where it will remain.


| Cooldowns  | Time to recover |
|------------|-----------------|
| Fast       |              1m |
| Swift      |         2m - 5m |
| Snappy     |       10m - 30m |
| Brisk      |         1h - 2h |
| Plodding   |         4h - 8h |
| Slow       |       16h - 24h |
| Sluggish   |         2d - 4d |
| Catatonic  |          1 week |

For example a generation 2 kitty will start off with a swift cooldown when born, and a generation 14 will be born with a plodding cooldown.


**Traits.** Certain traits are rarer than others, making the Kitty more desirable. 
As more kitties are bred with these traits and new traits are discovered, the value of each one can change.

Traits include:

- Body and Tail: Chartreux Cymric Himalayan Laperm Mainecoon Munchkin Ragamuffin Sphynx
- Pimary Color: Mauveover Cloudwhite Cottoncandy Salmon Shadowgrey Orangesoda Topaz Greymatter Cottoncandy Oldlace
- Secondary Color: Peach Bloodred Emeraldgreen Granitegrey Kittencream

**Q: Where do you see CryptoKitties 6 months from now?**

_Arthur Camara_:
6 months from now: there'll be tons of new genes, fancy cats, new features that enhance the gameplay. Managing larger collections will be easy and fun. Cats of all prices will be meaningful and we'll find new ways for people to play with their kitties. We want to enhance the meaning of ownership and make it even more fun.

  * * *

**Q: Can you please return the cat names to the breeding screen?**

_Benny Giang_:
Cat names was an awesome way to have personality in the marketplace but unfortunately, 
there were too many people taking advantage 
and tricking new users.

> Q: How does having names in the breeding screen trick new users? They are your own cats...
>
>> I list my gen 15 cat for sale and name it "RARE gen 0 SANTA mom" 
>> and new people not yet understanding how things work buy it. That was happening ALOT.

  * * *
   
**Q: We have 365k kitties now and under 196k total sales (kitties traded or sired). 
That combined with the drop in values suggests that the demand isn't keeping pace with the supply
[...] causing the market to tank. What do you think caused the crash? 
Are you working on strategies to increase kitty values or do you want the value to stabilize at $1 per cat or so as rumored?**

**Q: Any plans to make the market more sustainable for small investors? 
Currently, someone who invests only $10 can barely buy two kitties, let alone cover the cost to breed them. 
To make that worse, the likelihood that they'll be able to sell the offspring is minimal. What's your take?**

**Q: Any modification in plan regarding the mass supply of Gen 0s overcoming the demand?**

_Mack Flavelle_: To be honest, the market has been unpredictable for users and for us. We don't have any more visibility 
on what will happen next than any other user.

The market excelled much more quickly than we expected - the Gen 0 pricing is 50% more than the average of the last 5 kitties so it is completely determined by the market not us.

We really do believe that long term the kitties will capture a ton of value for users and fans, 
but it's important to remember that CryptoKitties is a decentralized game. 
We have very little control on the economy for good or for bad. 

Q1 of 2018 we have plans to stabilize the economy and reduce the volatility - in the long run we believe the kitties will be valuable.

Over time the economy will expand to be truly fun and valuable for high net worth players and new, exploratory players - a bigger, healthier economy creates value for everyone inside it. 


_Arthur Camara_: 
I believe we're building long term value to CryptoKitties with amazing features that are coming, new ways to play with the kitties, 
new interactions. And remember: there will only ever be 50,000 gen0 kitties, we are constantly adding features, fancy kitties are constantly being discovered.


_Benny Giang_: There are some interesting ideas around limiting the supply of kitties that we will explore in 2018.


**Q: Please let us have an option to recycle / trash worthless kitties in exchange for something.**

_Benny Giang_: Yup, a "kitty sink" could be useful for the market 
but there are also various of other viable solutions.


**Q: Where do you see CryptoKitties 6 years from now?**

_Arthur Camara_: CryptoKitties will be a global brand (way before that, actually). 
People will give CryptoKitties to their children 
on their first birthday. There'll be a complex ecosystem around the game, with lots of features and tools.
