_More (Minor) Milestones_

<!-- break
     move to traits? -->

- 2017 Dec/3 -  Due to network congestion, we are increasing the birthing fee from 0.001 ETH to 0.002 ETH. This will ensure your kittens are born on time! The extra is needed to incentivize miners to add birthing txs to the chain. Long-term solution will be explored very soon!
- 2017 Dec/4 - DUE TO CONGESTION ON THE NETWORK WE ARE INCREASING THE BIRTHING FEE FROM 0.002 ETH TO 0.015 ETH. WE HOPE THIS WILL ALLOW MORE KITTENS TO BE BORN ON TIME AS THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT DELAYS
- 2017 Dec/6 - WE ARE INCREASING THE RECOMMENDED DEFAULT GAS PRICE FROM 25 TO 40 GWEI IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE THE MINERS. AS ALWAYS YOU ARE ABLE TO ADJUST THIS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION
- 2017 Dec/11 - We have dropped the birthing fee from 0.015 ETH to 0.008 ETH. Happy breeding everyone!
- 2017 Dec/22-24 - Winter CryptoKitties Giveaway Contest

### Mania to Cooldown

#### Q: How popular is CryptoKitties?

In December 2017 - CryptoKitties Mania:

> CryptoKitties is now the most popular contract on ethereum, 
> accounting for 11 percent of total traffic (transactions).
>
> (Source: [CryptoKitties Mania Overwhelms Ethereum Network's Processing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/cryptokitties-quickly-becomes-most-widely-used-ethereum-app), December 4th, 2017)


> CryptoKitties make up over 20 percent of all ethereum computations

> (Source: [How CryptoKitties Disrupted the Ethereum Network](https://hackernoon.com/how-crypto-kitties-disrupted-the-ethereum-network-845c22aa1e6e), December 2017)


In April 2018 - CryptoKitties Cooldown:


> The number of active decentralized app (dapp) users [on ethereum] 
> is shockingly low, even for high-profile app like CryptoKitties.
>
> Citing data from DappRadar, Chris McCann reports that CryptoKitties has fewer than 1 000 daily active users (DAU). 
> Granted, interest has sharply declined over the past few months, 
> but he estimates that even at its peak the [CryptoKitties] app 
> likely only had about 14 000 daily users.
> Neopets, a game to which CryptoKitties is often compared, once had as many as 35 million users.

#### How Do the Founder Make Money with CryptoKitties?

- The founder auctioned off 100 founder gen 0 kitties on startup.
- The founder auctions off a new gen 0 kitty every 15 minutes until reaching 50 000 gen 0 ktties in November 2018.
  Note: The auction price gets automatically calculated from the last five sales plus 50%.
- The founder get a 3.75% cut (no minimum) on every transaction (selling auction, siring auction, etc.)
  on the official CryptoKitties marketplace.

Note: If you buy kitties you do NOT own the pictures (*) just the 256-bit hex string (on the blockchain),
thus, the founder can sell merchandise or license the pictures for profit. What a franchise!

(*): See Q: Do you really own your CryptoKitties? A: Spoiler: No.


#### How Can You Make Money with CryptoKitties?

No. 1 - Sell your kitties to a greater fool for a higher price!

No. 2 - Put up your kitties for siring (breeding) a new kitty in an auction and earn money for the service!
The rarer your kitties traits the higher your service fee income!

No. 3 - Breed your own new kitties and sell to a greater fool for a higher price!

#### Scams, Scams, Scams - The Art of the Steal

_Buyer Beware! Seller Beware! Here Be Dragons!_

**Scam #1: Selling Fake Labeled Cheap Kittens Expensive to Newbies (First Timers)**

It's like selling (fake) cheap Gucci handbags for the expensive Gucci price.
Best of both worlds. Buy low, sell high :-). Profit!

Example: I list my gen 15 cat for sale and name it "RARE gen 0 SANTA mom"
and new people not yet understanding how things work buy it.
That was happening ALOT.

Q: Can you please return the cat names to the breeding screen?

_Benny Giang_:
Cat names was an awesome way to have personality in the marketplace but unfortunately,
there were too many people taking advantage
and tricking new users.


**Scam #2: Fake Services Phishing (Stealing) Your Private Keys (Kitties)**

Put up a website that offers to find the perfect soul mate (with machine learing)
for siring new kitties with the rarest of the rarest traits.
Please enter your private key to get started. Thank you!
Now you've got new kitties for free. Profit!

**REMINDER: Trading or selling kitties off of the CryptoKitties marketplace can put your account at EXTREMELY HIGH RISK. NEVER expose your private key on any website for any matter at all. If you do so, you put yourself in a vulnerable position!**

#### Is CryptoKitties a Scam? Is CryptoKitties a Pyramid (Gambling) Scheme? Is CryptoKittes an Online (Gambling) Casino?

First the official answer from the CryptoKitties F.A.Q.:

##### Q: Is CryptoKitties a scam?

> No, this isn’t a scam.
> Anyone with insider knowledge of CryptoKitties - including our developers -
> are banned from participating.
> This is to prevent anyone from using their knowledge of the breeding algorithm
> to create the most valuable kinds of cat.

##### Q: Are CryptoKitties like dollars or like stuffed animals?

> CryptoKitties are NOT a cryptocurrency.
> They're more like a crypto collectible.
> The real-world analogy for a cryptocurrency is dollars or pounds;
a crypto collectible’s real world analogy is closer to stuffed animals beanie babys or fine tulip flower bulps.
>
> As dictated by the contract script on the blockchain, any CryptoKitty you own belongs to you (*).
> Like any product or property you can own, the market price is determined by what a greater fool
> is ready to pay (depending on demand, scarcity, and only limited by your asking price).

(Source: [CryptoKitties F.A.Q.](https://www.cryptokitties.co/faq))

(*): Note: See Q: Do you really own your CryptoKitties? A: Spoiler: No.


---

And here's an independent ("unofficial") answer:

##### Q: Is CryptoKitties a pyramid (gambling) scheme?

Yes, of course. It's gambling. CryptoKitties is designed on purpose for viral spreading.

With human nature is what it is - fear of missing out of getting-rich-quick and so on -
it works everytime like a charm once the hype starts (and prices go up and up).

More and more new greater fools buy more and more 256-bit hex strings (kitties on the blockchain)
until in the end running out of new greater fools paying ever higher prices.

Facebook has more than 1 000 000 000+ internet user. CryptoKitties is world-wide.
Will CryptoKitties ever run out of new greater fools?

##### Q: Is CryptoKitties an online gambling casino?

Gambling vs Investing

> Investments are generally not considered gambling when they meet the following criteria:
>
> - Economic utility
> - Positive expected returns (at least in the long term)
> - Underlying value independent of the risk being undertaken
>
> -- [What's Gambling @ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling)

For example, the mixing of genomes when breeding (siring) new kitties is a modern
"masqueraded" or fun way to roll a dice or spin a roulette wheel.
The betting (wagering) on rare traits is a modern "masqueraded" or fun
way of betting (wagering) on lucky numbers.

And, of course, the kitties
are a modern "masqueraded" or fun way of casino "funny money" tokens
rebranded as digital "virtual" cat collectibles or
non-fungible tokens (N.F.T.s).

**BEWARE: Gambling is fun and addictive. Winning and losing. Up and down.
Treat CryptoKittes as entertainment like casino gambling, sports betting or poker cards playing.
Do NOT "invest" trying to get-rich-quick
or raise the stakes trying to win back what you have lost, and so on.**

#### Casino & Gambling / "Market & Investing"

##### Q: What's the cost of playing?

A: Costs:

- Buying a cat.  (For sale / Buy now price varies; see [Marketplace / For Sale](https://www.cryptokitties.co/marketplace))
- Hiring a sire for your cat.  (Want to sire / Breed now price varies; see [Marketplace / Siring](https://www.cryptokitties.co/marketplace/siring))
- Breeding @ 0.008 ETH (*)

Fees:

- 3.75% Sales fee. (When you successfully sell or sire a cat on the marketplace.)
- Gas fees (**). These are transactions fees. Every time you start a transaction on the blockchain, you have to pay the "miners" to run the task. Transactions with gas fees incl.:
  - Buying a cat / hiring a sire.
  - Breeding.
  - Putting a cat up for auction (sell or sire).
  - Taking a cat down from auction (sell or sire). [Note: Note: If you cat doesn't sell, it stays up for auction until you take it down.]


(*): The breeding fee was at first 0.001 ETH. Due to high transaction traffic on the blockchain
  the founders had to raise the fee because the breeding fee has to be higher than gas fees to birth a new kitty.

(**): The gas fee is shown before you send off a transaction. It is roughly between $0.30 - $3.00
 (depending on blockchain traffic).


<!-- old text

##### Q: What's the population? How many gen0 kitties will there be?

A: 50_000 Gen 0 Kitties

- CryptoKitties started with 100 founder kitties - see #1 (Genesis!) to #100.
- Every 15 minutes a new gen0 kitty (also known as "clock cat")
  gets added (that is, 4 gen0 kitties/hour, 96 gen0 kitties/day, 672 gen0 kitties/week)
  and sold by (dutch) clock auction (*) until reaching a limit of 50_000 in one year (end of November 2018) -
  see #1001 for first clock cat.

(*): A gen0 kitty's start price is automatically calculated by the average price
of the last five kitty sales, plus 50% and sold by a descending clock auction; see [Marketplace / Gen 0](https://www.cryptokitties.co/marketplace/gen0).

##### Q: What's a clock auction?

It's an auction with an automatically calculated descending price by clock (that is, the prices depends on the time of the purchase).
Sellers choose a high opening bid, a minimum closing bid, and a timeframe for the auction to run.
Buyers choose their purchase price along that spectrum by purchasing when the price aligns with their perceived value of the CryptoKitty being sold - as long as someone else doesn't buy it befor.
Note: Buyers pay gas when they complete a purchase and sellers pay gas to start an auction.



##### Q: What make's a kitty good?

A: The generation, cooldown speed, traits, and all affect the overall price and desirability of the kitties.
Generally, anything gen(eration) 0/1/2/3/4, with fast/swift/snappy/brisk is a good kitty. Rare traits make it even better.

**Generation.** The best generation of kitty is Gen 0.
The lower the generation number, the better starting cooldown the kitty is born with.

When breeding two kitties together, the resulting generation will be one higher than the highest generation parent.
For example:

* If a Gen 0 and Gen 0 breed, the kitten will be Gen 1.
* If a Gen 5 and Gen 5 breed, the kitten will be Gen 6.
* If a Gen 0 and a Gen 5 breed, the kitten will be Gen 6.

**Cooldowns.**  Each time a kitty breeds another kitty it needs a
period of cooldown time to recover. The cooldown wait time increases every time
a kitty breeds until it reaches "catatonic" cooldown, where it will remain.

Note: Cooldowns -
fast (1m) › swift (2m·5m) › snappy (10m·30m) › brisk (1h·2h) ›
plodding (4h·8h) › slow (16h·24h) › sluggish (2d·4d) › catatonic (1w) -
are NOT inherited but depend on the generation, that is,  
each new kitty is born with a cooldown based on its generation (gen).

|  Gen      | (+) Kids |  Cooldown  | Time to Recover |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
|   0 · 1   |          | Fast       | 1 minute        |

|   4 · 5   |          | -^^^-      | 5 minutes       |
|   6 · 7   |          | Snappy     | 10 minutes      |
|   8 · 9   |          | -^^^-      | 30 minutes      |
|  10 · 11  |          | Brisk      | 1 hours         |
|  12 · 13  |          | -^^^-      | 2 hours         |  
|  14 · 15  |          | Plodding   | 4 hours         |
|  16 · 17  |          | -^^^-      | 8 hours         |
|  18 · 19  |          | Slow       | 16 hours        |
|  20 · 21  |          | -^^^-      | 24 hours        |
|  22 · 23  |          | Sluggish   | 2 days          |
|  24 · 45  |          | -^^^-      | 4 days          |
|  26+      |          | Catatonic  | 1 week          |

Examples:

A gen 2 kitty will start off with a swift 2 minutes cooldown when born,
and a gen 14 will be born with a plodding 4 hours cooldown.

A gen 11 kitty virgin will start off with a brisk 1 hours cooldown (slot gen 10·11) when born,
but after having 3 kids will end up 3 slots down with a plodding 8 hours cooldown (slot gen 16·17).

| Snappy     |       10m - 30m |

**Q: Where do you see CryptoKitties 6 months from now?**

_Arthur Camara_:
6 months from now: there'll be tons of new genes, fancy cats, new features that enhance the gameplay. Managing larger collections will be easy and fun. Cats of all prices will be meaningful and we'll find new ways for people to play with their kitties. We want to enhance the meaning of ownership and make it even more fun.

  * * *

**Q: We have 365k kitties now and under 196k total sales (kitties traded or sired).
That combined with the drop in values suggests that the demand isn't keeping pace with the supply
[...] causing the market to tank. What do you think caused the crash?
Are you working on strategies to increase kitty values or do you want the value to stabilize at $1 per cat or so as rumored?**

**Q: Any plans to make the market more sustainable for small investors?
Currently, someone who invests only $10 can barely buy two kitties, let alone cover the cost to breed them.
To make that worse, the likelihood that they'll be able to sell the offspring is minimal. What's your take?**

**Q: Any modification in plan regarding the mass supply of Gen 0s overcoming the demand?**

_Mack Flavelle_: To be honest, the market has been unpredictable for users and for us. We don't have any more visibility
on what will happen next than any other user.

The market excelled much more quickly than we expected - the Gen 0 pricing is 50% more than the average of the last 5 kitties so it is completely determined by the market not us.

We really do believe that long term the kitties will capture a ton of value for users and fans,
but it's important to remember that CryptoKitties is a decentralized game.
We have very little control on the economy for good or for bad.

Q1 of 2018 we have plans to stabilize the economy and reduce the volatility - in the long run we believe the kitties will be valuable.

Over time the economy will expand to be truly fun and valuable for high net worth players and new, exploratory players - a bigger, healthier economy creates value for everyone inside it.


_Arthur Camara_:
I believe we're building long term value to CryptoKitties with amazing features that are coming, new ways to play with the kitties,
new interactions. And remember: there will only ever be 50,000 gen0 kitties, we are constantly adding features, fancy kitties are constantly being discovered.


_Benny Giang_: There are some interesting ideas around limiting the supply of kitties that we will explore in 2018.


**Q: Please let us have an option to recycle / trash worthless kitties in exchange for something.**

_Benny Giang_: Yup, a "kitty sink" could be useful for the market
but there are also various of other viable solutions.


**Q: Where do you see CryptoKitties 6 years from now?**

_Arthur Camara_: CryptoKitties will be a global brand (way before that, actually).
People will give CryptoKitties to their children
on their first birthday. There'll be a complex ecosystem around the game, with lots of features and tools.

**Q: What's different?**

Too simple. Buy, sell and hodl (collect). That's it.
Fixed 10 000  collection. No new CyperPunks creation (eg. pairing of genomes) possible.
No growth. No "mystery" genome and new surprise genes and attributes etc. Where's the fun? :-).
