### Questions & Answers

_Tech_

**Q: Couldn't CryptoKitties be hosted on many types of databases besides a blockchain?**

> A: Crypto-collectibles have key properties that proprietary digital collectibles didn't: 
> longevity, code-enforced scarcity and rules, resistance to actions of sponsoring company. 
> Much closer to non-digital collectibles like baseball cards than pre-crypto digital goods.

_Market & Gaming_


**Q: What's the cost of playing?**

A:

* Price of kitties that you purchase.
* Fees for breeding two kitties together (about $0.50 to $0.60 as of 3rd December 2017).
* Fees for listing the sale auction to sell your kitties (about $0.20 as of 3rd December 2017).
* Additional funds in your wallet to allow the transactions to occur.


**Q: What make's a kitty good?**

A: Generally, anything gen(eration) 0/1/2/3/4, with fast/swift/snappy/brisk is a good kitty. Rare traits make it even better.
The generation, cooldown speed, traits, and all affect the overall price and desirability of the kitties.

**Generation.** The best generation of kitty is Gen 0. 
The lower the generation number, the better starting cooldown the kitty is born with. 

When breeding two kitties together, the resulting generation will be one higher than the highest generation parent. 
For example:

* If a Gen 0 and Gen 0 breed, the kitten will be Gen 1. 
* If a Gen 5 and Gen 5 breed, the kitten will be Gen 6.
* If a Gen 0 and a Gen 5 breed, the kitten will be Gen 6.

**Cooldown speed.** Each time a kitty breeds, their cooldown moves down to the next level, 
until it reaches Catatonic cooldown, where it will remain.

For example a generation 2 kitty will start off with a swift cooldown when born, and a generation 14 will be born with a plodding cooldown.

**Traits.** Certain traits are rarer than others, making the Kitty more desirable. 
As more kitties are bred with these traits and new traits are discovered, the value of each one can change.

Traits include:

- Body and Tail: Chartreux Cymric Himalayan Laperm Mainecoon Munchkin Ragamuffin Sphynx
- Pimary Color: Mauveover Cloudwhite Cottoncandy Salmon Shadowgrey Orangesoda Topaz Greymatter Cottoncandy Oldlace
- Secondary Color: Peach Bloodred Emeraldgreen Granitegrey Kittencream

A: Use these website services:
